Crude test plans.

plugin-resynthesizer-gui

Unchanged features

1. No selection in either source or target.  Expect no warning dialogs or errors from engine.
2. Source image same as target image.  Expect no warning dialogs or errors from engine.
3. Source image is mode RGBA and target is mode RGB.  Expect no warning dialogs or errors from engine.

New code, python plugin catches user errors crudely (whereas GTK could filter choices in advance.)

4. Source image is indexed mode.  Expect error dialog and engine not called.
5. Source image is mode grayscale and target is mode RGB.  Expect error dialog and engine not called.
