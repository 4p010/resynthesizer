# a chain of containers, to minimize rebuilding as changes are made.
# Each container depends on previous as specified by "!Container foo"

containers:
  
  # basic OS with dev (compiling)
  baseOS:
    setup:
    # base OS is ubuntu 18.10
    # - !Ubuntu cosmic
    - !Ubuntu disco
    # enable universe repository (where gimp lives)
    - !UbuntuUniverse
    # tools for dev (C compiler)
    - !Install [build-essential]
    


  # with gimp and gimp dev
  gimpdev:
    setup:
    - !Container baseOS

    # gimp is only a run-time requirement, but install it early
    - !Install [gimp]

    # install prereqs for building any gimp plugin
    # As documented in resynthesizer/readme.md
    - !Install [libgimp2.0-dev, libglib2.0-dev, automake, intltool]

    # Define HOME.
    # Without this, HOME is /root
    # Gimp tries to write ~/.local/share (Gnome standard location for user data)
    # Avoids error: "/root/.local/share: read-only file system"
    environ:
      HOME: /work/.home


  # with resynthesizer plugin
  resynth:
    setup:
    - !Container gimpdev

    # Not used: this works, but doesn't keep the repository (with test images)
    # Clone repository into temp directory and execute build script
    #- !GitInstall
    #  url: git://github.com/bootchk/resynthesizer
    #  script: ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make && make install

    # Clone repository
    - !Git
      url: git://github.com/bootchk/resynthesizer
      path: /home/resynthesizer

    # cd to repository and build it
    # Build script is a sequence of sh commands, "&&" means each depends on success of previous.
    # As documented in build instructions in resynthesizer/readme.md
    - !Sh cd /home/resynthesizer && ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make && make install
