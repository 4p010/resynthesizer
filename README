This package is a set of plugins for use with the Gimp program.
The package includes:

- resynthesizer plugin engine (without a GUI)
- resynthesizer-gui plugin control panel for the engine
- various Python language plugins that call the resynthesizer engine

It builds with autotools.  Many of the build files (Makefile.am, configure.in, etc.) were hacked from the gimp-plugin-template 2.2.0.

To build and install it, just ...

  ./autogen.sh
	./configure
	make
	make install

Note the default gcc flags seem to be: -g -O2 -Wall.
To optimize more, pass the CFLAGS (perogative of the builder to alter compilation):

make CFLAGS=-O3


Building on other platforms
===========================

(On the darkside OS, who hijacked a common word for fenestration)

I use MinGW and MSYS
(Use mingw-get to download gnu build tools perl, automake etc.)
However it doesn't install plugins properly.
You will need to copy files to the proper Gimp plugin install directory,
typically from:
c:\MSYS\1.0\usr\local\lib\gimp\2.0\plug-ins 
to:
c:\users\yourname\.gimp-2.6\plug-ins
